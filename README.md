## About
This project is based on the Pomodoro Technique, using Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Tkinter module. The goal of this project is to beat procrastination and improve your focus one Pomodoro at a time

## How Pomodoro Technique Works?
When you start the Pomodoro, the timer will start the countdown, meaning that your Pomodoro has just started.

After **25 minutes** have passed, a new timer will be open to show the message **"Break"**, so it's time for a **Short Break**. It lasts **5 minutes**.

Once the short break time is over, another timer will be open telling you it's **"Work"**, and another session of 25 minutes of work will be started.

This process will be repeated **4 times**, but the last break (**Long Break**) will last **25 minutes**.
